# parallel-shader-test

This sample application tests KHR_parallel_shader_compile

## Getting Started

You must have a driver with OpenGL 4.6 support.

Building this requires CMake, GLFW, and GLEW.

To compile, from the project root, run

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The binaries will be put in a bin directory in the project root.
